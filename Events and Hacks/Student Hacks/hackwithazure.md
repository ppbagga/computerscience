## What is Azure?
Azure is a cloud computing platform (similar to AWS and Google Cloud Platform). We offer a broad range of services for developers to create with. 

In particular, Azure has great, beginner-friendly services to help you use...
- [AI/Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/ai-platform/)
- [Virtual Machines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/)
- [Web Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/)
- [Containers (Docker/Kubernetes)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/)
- [Bots](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)

...in your hacks! 

[Check the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/#pivot=get-started&panel=get-started1) on how to get started with Azure. We offer a full range of labs with [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/). See more details below.

## How to get free Azure credits

Not working? Come to the Microsoft booth and we'll get it fixed.

You may already have an MSA (@outlook.com or @hotmail.com email, or could be associated with any other email address). If you don't, you can create one at [https://signup.live.com/](https://signup.live.com/) or as part of the instructions below.

## Azure hackathon prize
Use any Azure service (like, any of them...) and enter our Azure prize. Winners will recieve a Surface Pro 5 for each team member and your hack will be entered into our Imagine Cup competition (the grand prize last year was a mentoring session with CEO Satya and $100k).

See below for details.

## So you want to work (or intern) at Microsoft?
Apply for internship or fulltime jobs at [careers.microsoft.com](careers.microsoft.com)!
We do not accept paper resumes and none of us are recruiters, but if you catch us with a free moment we're happy to tell you about our personal experiences going through the recruiting process.
